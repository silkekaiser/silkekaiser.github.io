# Welcome

I am a Ph.D. student at the Berlin School of Economics and am being supervised by [Prof. Lynn Kaack](https://lynnkaack.com/index.html) at [Hertie School Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab/people/profile/person/kaiser). My research focuses on bicycle mobility data and statistical machine learning. I hope with my projects to contribute to a better quality of life in urban spaces.

Previously I studied at Université Panthéon-Sorbonne, where I obtained an M.Sc. in Quantitative Economics, and at Sciences Po Paris, for an M.Sc. in Research Economics which I finished with distinction.
