        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Ph.D. student at the Berlin School of Economics and am being supervised by
            [Prof. Lynn Kaack](https://lynnkaack.com/index.html) at [Hertie School Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab/people/profile/person/kaiser).
            My research focuses on bicycle mobility data and statistical machine learning. I hope with my projects
            to contribute to a better quality of life in urban spaces.
        </p>

            Previously I studied at Université Panthéon-Sorbonne, where I obtained an M.Sc. in Quantitative Economics,
            and at Sciences Po Paris, for an M.Sc. in Research Economics which I finished with distinction.
