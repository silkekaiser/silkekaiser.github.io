            I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://berlinschoolofeconomics.de/home">Berlin School of Economics</a>  and am being supervised by
            <a href="https://lynnkaack.com/index.html">Prof. Lynn Kaack</a> at
            <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab/people/profile/person/kaiser">Hertie School Berlin</a>.
            My research focuses on bicycle mobility data and statistical machine learning. I hope with my projects
            to contribute to a better quality of life in urban spaces.

            Previously I studied at Université Panthéon-Sorbonne, where I obtained an M.Sc. in Quantitative Economics,
            and at Sciences Po Paris, for an M.Sc. in Research Economics which I finished with distinction.
