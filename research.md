## Research Interest

I am working at the intersection of machine learning and sustainable transport research. My interests include also applied econometrics, AI and spatio-temporal applications of statistics.

## Working Papers

**Predicting cycling traffic in cities: Is bikesharing data representative of the cycling volume?** 

With Lynn H. Kaack and Nadja Klein [Link](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-hsog/files/4942/Kaiser_Klein_Kaack_2023_Predicting_cycling.pdf)

* Poster presented at the Workshop "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Global Perspectives and Local Challenges" at ICLR 2023 [Link](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/13461)

* A prediction of cycling volume in Berlin, using the methods described in the paper, can be found here for the whole city of Berlin, and a streetwise prediction for a subpart of Berlin:
