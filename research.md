# Research Interest
I am working at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, econometrics, and transport research. My current projects evolve around spatiotemporally complex cycling data and how they can be used as input for predictions of general cycling volume using ML.

**Working Papers**

Predicting cycling traffic in cities: Is bikesharing data representative of the cycling volume? With Lynn H. Kaack and Nadja Klein [Link](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-hsog/files/4942/Kaiser_Klein_Kaack_2023_Predicting_cycling.pdf)
Poster presented at the Workshop "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Global Perspectives and Local Challenges" at ICLR 2023 [Linke](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/13461)

A prediction of cycling volume in Berlin, using the methods described in the paper, can be found here:
